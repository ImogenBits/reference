# Reference.h, a simple C header to pass values by reference

Ae you tired of people telling you to switch to C++ because C doesn't even have pass-by-reference?  
Don't worry! just* include reference.h and you too can pass references without messing with those weird "pointers".  
There genuinely is nothing akin to pointer dereferencing going on here! When using this the code will continue to do exactly what you want it to do, modify an argument variable

*(functionality entirely dependent on compiler mood)
